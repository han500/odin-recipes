        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This butternut squash made with chicken broth is slightly sweet. It's one of the best soups I've had in a 
            while!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cube chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and thyme and sauté until onion has 
                softened, about 5 minutes. Add squash and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, then cook until squash is 
                tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble bouillon into the soup. Season with cumin, allspice, salt, and 
                pepper, then remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Working in batches, pour soup into a blender, filling no more than halfway. Hold the lid in place with 
                a kitchen towel, then carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before 
                leaving it on to purée. Pour soup into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and 
                purée the soup in the pot.
